</Steps>


## Chromebox Connections & Mounting
The Chromebox device only needs a single USB C connection to function.
The HDMI port is not used in this setup, but can be if you are using a different monitor.
Additionally, the monitor provides power to the Chromebox via the USB C cable.  The power adapter was included for other setups but is not needed when using the recommended Dell monitor.

<Steps>

    1. Locate the other end of the USB C cable you previously connected to the monitor.
        <Image url="/monitor-setup/9.png" alt="USB A Connector"/>
    2. Connect it to either of the USB C ports on the Chromebox.
        <Image url="/monitor-setup/15.png" alt="USB A Ports on monitor"/>
    3. The suggested mounting location for the chromebox is on the top of the monitor stand.

    4. The device can be secured using double sided 3M Tape or Velcro (Recommended).  Please ensure you leave enough room above the device for the monitor to tilt.
