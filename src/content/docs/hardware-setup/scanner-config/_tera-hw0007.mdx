description: Programming QR codes for the Tera HW0007 Hands-free Desktop Barcode Scanner
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Tera HW0007 is a wireless gun-style barcode scanner.  It is stored in its charging cradle and can be removed to scan barcodes upon trigger pull.

:::note
Check out the [Tera 9000](/hardware-setup/tera-9000) instead.  It is the recommended scanner for most applications as it is hands-free and requires no trigger pull.
:::

Scan each of the following QR codes using the barcode scanner.  These configure the scanner to work with the rest of the system.

:::danger[Careful]
The scanner has a wide field of view and could accidentally scan a different code.  **Try covering the other codes with your hand**, or zooming so only one is visible.
