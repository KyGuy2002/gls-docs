### <Badge text="GET" variant="success" size="large"/> /api/stats
This endpoint allows you to get the time series statistics displayed on the stats TV displays.

:::danger[Important]
This is used by the stats TV displays to show an overview of the system.<br/>
You may want to consider using the [general metrics endpoint](/api-doc/data/stats/metrics) instead for faster loading times and a smaller response.  That API also exposes more data.
:::

:::note
Statistics are cached on the server and only updated every 25 minutes.<br/>
Last updated time is included in the response.
