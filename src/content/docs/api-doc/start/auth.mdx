Authenticating with the Lumen Insight API is super simple.  All you need is an API key with sufficient permissions.


## Generate an API Key
API keys can be generated within your systems dashboard.
<Steps>

    1. Log in to your Lumen Insight dashboard.

    2. Navigate to the `API Keys` page.<br/>
        If you don't see this page then you may not have permission.  Please contact your administrator to get access.
    
    3. Click the `Create API Key` button.

    4. Choose a memorable name for your API key.  This is just for you to identify it with in audit logs.

    5. Select the permissions you want to grant this API key.<br/>
        Please only select the permissions you need.  The more permissions you select, the more risk you are taking on.

    6. Click `Create` and copy the API key to your clipboard.<br/>

        This is the only time you will be able to see this API key.  If you lose it, you will need to create a new one.

</Steps>


## Using the API Key
Add the API key header to all your requests to the Lumen Insight API.  The header should look like this:
```http
X-API-KEY: <your-api-key>
```


## Impersonating Portal Users
Some API endpoints are designed to be used by visitors through the registration portal.<br/>
You can impersonate any user to perform actions on their behalf.  This is useful for automating appointment requests or registrations.

Your API key will need the permission: <Badge text="IMPERSONATE_PORTAL_USER" variant="caution" /><br/>
:::note
No other permissions are required to impersonate a user.<br/>
Anything that can be done from the portal can be done with this single permission.
:::

You must also include these headers (in addition to the `X-API-KEY` header) to identify the **registered** user making the request:
```http
X-IMPERSONATED-USER-FIRST-NAME: <first-name>
X-IMPERSONATED-USER-LAST-NAME: <last-name>
X-IMPERSONATED-USER-EMAIL: <email>
```

:::note
Only **registered users** can be impersonated.
