This guide will help you connect your kiosk or display device to a different Wi-Fi network or update the Wi-Fi password.

:::note
You will need to connect a keyboard to your device to complete these steps.

<Steps>

    1. Reboot the device.
       You can do this by unplugging it from power, waiting 10 seconds, and plugging it back in.
    2. Wait for the kiosk startup screen to appear.  This can take a few seconds.

    3. As soon as the startup screen appears, press and **hold** CTRL+ALT+S on the keyboard.
       :::note
       If the device attempts to boot into kiosk mode before you press the keys, simply reboot and try again.
       :::
    4. Once the startup screen disappears, release the keys.
    5. You can now access the Wi-Fi settings menu in the bottom right corner of the screen.
    6. When you are done updating the Wi-Fi settings, reboot the device again to test your changes and return to kiosk mode.
