When adding a Google Calendar to your Lumen Insight system, you will need to find the calendar ID.  This is a unique identifier for your calendar that allows our system to identify it.

<Steps>

    1. Open your [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) app.
    2. Find your calendar in the bottom left sidebar.
    3. Hover over the calendar name and click the three dots that appear.
    4. Click "Settings" and scroll down to the "Integrate Calendar" section.
    5. Copy the "Calendar ID" value.
