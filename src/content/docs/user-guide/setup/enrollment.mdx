Enrolling your ChromeOS device is a critical step in the setup process.  This ensures that your device is securely configured to run the kiosk application and communicate with the Lumen Insight platform.  It also allows you to manage the device remotely, including updating the kiosk application and monitoring its status.

:::caution
This step is not required but is highly encoraged.  Without it, you will be responsible for managing the device and keeping it up to date.  This includes installing updates, monitoring the device's status, and troubleshooting any issues that may arise.

### ChromeBox Setup
The ChromeBox device is very easy to set up.  All you need to do is enter your wifi information or connect an ethernet cable (recommended), and then sign in with the provided credentials.

If the device asks you to “Turn on screen reader”, simply select `Close`.
